Michael Boselowitz<br />
CS 1520 - Friday @ 3 - Andrew Conn<br />
Assignment 3<br /><br />

Due: March 25th @ midnight<br />
Handed in: March 25th @ ~10:00<br /><br />

Source:<br />
-index.html - The home page<br />
-user.php - Handles submitting of tickets<br />
-adminlogin.php - Handles the logging in of admins<br />
-admin.php - The main admin page, contains the main list of tickets and options<br />
-adminedit.php - The page for selecting one ticket<br />
-adminsame.php - For displaying tickets with same submitter, very similar to admin.php<br />
-adminsimilar.php - For displaying tickets with similar problems/subjects, also very similar to admin.php<br />
-init.php - This will initiate all the tables to default<br /><br />

<p>I believe this works without error and captures most if not all requirements, to my understanding at least.</p>
